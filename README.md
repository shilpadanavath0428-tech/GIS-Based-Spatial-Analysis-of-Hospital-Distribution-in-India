Abstract

Healthcare accessibility is a fundamental determinant of social welfare and regional development. This study presents a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based spatial analysis of hospital distribution across India using a national hospital directory dataset comprising 30,273 hospital records and 48 attributes. The research aims to evaluate regional disparities in healthcare infrastructure, assess emergency service availability, analyze hospital bed capacity, and understand public versus private sector participation in healthcare delivery.

Using data preprocessing, descriptive statistical methods, and spatial aggregation techniques implemented in Python, the study identifies significant geographical imbalances in hospital distribution. Western and Southern states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat exhibit higher hospital density, while several northeastern and union territories show limited infrastructure. The findings also reveal substantial data incompleteness in emergency service reporting and hospital categorization.

This research demonstrates how GIS-based data analytics can support evidence-based healthcare planning, policy formulation, and equitable resource allocation. The study contributes to spatial health analytics by integrating statistical interpretation with geospatial thinking for infrastructure assessment.
